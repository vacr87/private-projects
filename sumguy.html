This is about how she’s flooded <br>
With the peace that issues from a tangled source.<br>
<br>
Going about her day,<br>
Always aware of the aperture.<br>
<br>
She’s been told about Divine Peace,<br>
But this woman is honest.<br>
<br>
Going about her day …<br>
Sometimes the aperture,<br>
And her understanding looks <br>
Backwards through the floodwaters, and<br>
Into the aperture,<br>
And into the tangled zone<br>
Of peace only partly processed <br>
To divine light.<br>
<br>
That insane tangle<br>
After divinity but before<br>
Her going about her business,<br>
And only she, this honest woman,<br>
Sees how normal life<br>
Is only not insane<br>
Because it would be insane<br>
To say everything is.<br>

<br>
Camouflaged desires<br>
Rustling of sound,<br>
She becomes attracted to the word, <br>
Jaywalking,<br>
Feeling the sound of the word camouflaged<br>
Would have lacked the sharp, clipped sounds<br>
To match her quick step. <br>
<br>
Now on the other side of Reconciliation,<br>
Acute knowledge that her movements<br>
Orchestrate her emotions,<br>
Her freewill becoming unable to  resist <br>
a vividness, <br>
Long and smooth, <br>
Beneath her surface aspirations,<br>
Ambiguity screwing <br>
Promiscuous hinges <br>
Between the two sides of herself that<br>
She believes in thoroughly,<br>
A staging of emotion preventing her from realizing<br>
That if she hadn’t jaywalked<br>
She would have walked by the liquor store.<br>
<br>
Folding a duplicate,<br>
And she’s opened into existence<br>
On opposite sides of the street at the same time.<br>
<br>
On the opposite sides <br>
Of anything<br>
At the same time.<br>
<br>
To get clear headed she must <br>
Find a way to become real.<br>
<br>
Of course she has Long<br> 
Accepted <br>
She’s at all times <br>
Suspended untouched<br>
Between unpleasant fabrics, <br>
A means to find herself when she’s in the dark. <br>
<br>
She was in Peru once, or<br>
<br>
Was the jungle in Borneo …? <br>
But just applying makeup,<br>
Eyebrow pencil, lipstick,<br>
Knowing how to get to those<br>
Tourist destinations of the desires, <br>
At least.<br>
<br>
She opens up her face, sees a girl.<br>
Looking into the child’s innocent eyes<br>
Her adult form sees that the child remembers her<br>
From the future,<br>
And even now, brushing the<br>
Tangles out of her hair,<br>
Cleaning strands from the bristles, she<br>
Knows the day will arrive when her face will close.<br>
<br>
This lets her see herself from all sides.<br>
But she’s probably sideways<br>
In a way sleeping would be most mortal, because<br>
One view of her shows the bottoms of her feet, <br>
The other the top of her head.<br>
Again this woman finds herself on both sides of something.<br>
<br>
Like someone has just come into the room,<br>
Has seen the carved parrot,<br>
Noticing the  hinges,<br>
And now she’s become somebody <br>
Who doesn’t know which half,<br>
But tolerates the thoughts of the person standing out there looking in<br>
At her getting opinions<br>
About how she should have handled the situation in the first place. <br>
<br>
No, <br>
I could have handled my part differently.<br>
I see it now, it<br>
Was never about him, <br>
It was about me;<br>
<br>
And he turns,<br>
Decides not to go into the liquor store after all,<br>
Turns for home,<br>
The problem not ever about her, it was about me,<br>
<br>
But she never found any rational way to talk about reconciliation,<br>
Always the two of them,<br>
On the opposite sides <br>
Of anything<br>
At the same time. <br>
<br>
And they lived … and …<br>

But die and become absorbed<br>
Into genius,<br>

Today one of the days<br>
They exist as form. <br>

You yourself may have enough sensitivity <br>
To recognize the differences <br>
Between the two feelings —<br>
A certain feel when you are in your body, <br>
And a different feel <br>
When you exist as form. <br>

When in your body<br>
Autonomy, privacy, even sovereign<br>
And defining authority within your Consciousness.<br>

Privacy no longer an issue. <br>
You are form,<br>
You are a living and breathing  idea,<br>
You are an idea: to be shared. <br>

Mother and daughter, so smooth <br>
in their forms,<br>

To share themselves.<br>

Mother and daughter in their bodies<br>
Bathing in utter and sovereign privacy,<br>
Somewhere in the world sharing a towel,<br>
Drying …<br>
Maybe a leg now …<br>
While you add to the <br>
<br>
Totality of world experience running your Fingers over their forms<br>
Changing inside yourself, the act of<br>
Touching these forms teaching you<br>
How to recognize the broader you,<br>
Who contains you.<br>
<br>
Here you are, running your hands over<br>
Their forms, Mother, Daughter,<br>
Recognizing and learning the differences <br>
Of feel between when<br>
You are in your body<br>
And when you are form. <br>
<br>
Touching them, you yourself are form,<br>
And another part of your mind sees<br>
How it feels to be in your body, seeing<br>
Your reactions while interacting with these<br>
Beautifully crafted <br>
Mother and daughter forms.<br>
<br>
And now, living both in your body<br>
And outside your body as an idea<br>
Sensitive to your body’s inner reactions,<br>
You move through a brief experience<br>
Of being yourself,<br>
Yourself and complete, then the spell breaks,<br>
You’re back in your body again,<br>
Happy. Walking over to look at something else<br>

<br>
I’m not hanging upside down, but you, friend, are down there with the damp-smelling earth and roots, head tipped back listening to the sound of my steps up here this spring morning taking a walk along the neighborhood of Sky-land I love most, with the sun aslant along the blue topsoil, strolling the easy path, delighting in how plasma ignites around my ankles tender, temporary bouquets that I kick into becoming stars like sea foam. <br>
<br>
If I were to actually be somebody, then I’d be the person who gave the world it’s idea of wholeness, famous for giving the world the idea that one day back in the past something first began. When someone would have a feeling of one moment moving into the next, they’d thank me for giving them that idea letting them not see change not changing. I would invent wholeness, I am not upside down, but am who can both live in contentment, and at the same time drink the solar winds of infinity.<br> 
<br>
I am biology, you would be the early morning dream. You would live earlier than the idea of resolution. You would be where longing to have a lover and fear of a sky-lover would, by being the same world, keep you … too alive, exceedingly undecided …<br>
<br>
All of this only someplace that somebody else will walk by. All of this but a waystation, a half-thought that lays a few feet off the path … and here comes somebody … without noticing us here … lost in the magnificence of her ability to be grounded in reality. And she’s not upside down.<br>
<br>
And we’re fully aware that wide privacy is never not our first possibility. <br>

Is no land for dying.<br>

After the loss of color?<br>
<br>
When the burn of fire is still here, and remains<br>
After the loss of temperature.<br>
<br>
When the river continues on, straight out,<br>
And beyond the lip of the disassembling Waterfall of moments?<br>
<br>
What remains of love,<br>
A sound in the distance?<br>
After your body is hollow if it,<br>
After you are inside a tall mouth<br>
That is a cave of wind-fire singing?<br>
<br>
What remains then, of the song<br>
After you’ve become the mouth of the singer?<br>
What remains of death<br>
Now that you live as that idea?<br>

Once there is nothing prosaic in the world,<br>
Once there is no such thing as profound,<br>

And pelicans and worms,<br>
And Saturday nights out?<br>

How will you ever again trust commonsense,<br>
How will you keep from feeling nature<br>
Is but your mother fantasy,<br>
How will you feel<br>
Alone after your beloved has died, what method after the night<br>
You accompanied her departing soul<br>
Too far out, too far out,<br>
To, far out. To, far out,<br>
When your single step from this world …<br>
A half step … was a million miles long,<br>
Coming up an inch short<br>
Of completing that final stroll<br>
The edge beyond which you have turned back Around, come back with your heart  holding the Last untried way to love,<br>
That is now your task to learn,<br>
And … but now you ask,<br>
Who WAS this woman?<br>
Who?<br>
<br>
And even you .. now you .. here…<br>
Returning from reverie to your senses<br>
Maybe fidgeting a finger,<br>
The finger you’ve only now become conscious<br>
Of moving?<br>
<br>
But you’ve always know there exists<br>
A way to love that nobody  tires.<br>
<br>
And this way, never before tired,<br>
Has become your last remaining option ..<br>
Now …<br>
Speechless,<br>
You haven’t met that part of yourself,<br>
But can only believe there’s still a way<br>
To love that you haven’t tried,<br>

And agreeing there is no risk in life<br>
Is all it takes<br>
For ethics to sprout up into behavior<br>
From the core of hyper lush passion,<br>
And spread out the most amazing, hyper lush,<br>
Dance floor. <br>
Hand me another drugged flower, <br>
They’re delicious. <br>
<br>
Right on, my sister, I’ll dance to that, but<br>
How do we tell good passion from bad?<br>
<br>
Watch me … the kind that makes us dance the fandango!<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Swan</b></font><br>
<br>
Moon rising to a <br>
Red night bird<br>
Woman changing slowly  <br>
Into a chair,<br>
Resting in the seat <br>
Of her emotions. <br>
What hovers such honied air?<br>
<br>
A swan chair <br>
In the light<br>
Of that swan moon<br>
On the shores of that <br>
Silvered lake.<br>
<br>
Seat of emotions, a <br>
Little boat,<br>
Because it was a swan,<br>
Moonlit in the elegant,<br>
Multi-honied air<br>
That aquifer, <br>
That<br>
Moonlit night.<br>
<br>
Swan would be a stork,<br>
The chair lifting <br>
A leg, <br>
The bird’s<br>
<br>
Red mouthed lover<br>
With a leg of flesh<br>
Dangling a hot red slipper,<br>
Her gown of bleeding white. <br>
<br>
Up from the seat <br>
Of the passions <br>
Seated in such changes,<br>
You had just cut <br>
<br>
Your finger  …<br>
You’re bleeding …<br>
<br>
On a sharp kitchen knife.<br>
<br>
And you went back to<br>
Your red bird. <br>
You are  that moonlit night.<br>
You are that swan moon.<br>
<br>
Someone held <br>
You aloft in the swan<br>
Moonlight <br>
That windy night, you<br>
Bled out, bled<br>
The needs of your love,<br>
Creating  the skies over Kansas, now, someone had<br>
Thrown you to the wind, red bird,<br>
Blown from  some mountain in Colorado,<br>
Blown from the hands<br>
Of someone you loved.<br>
<br>
The wind … wind …<br>
<br>
The wind, <br>
Would they release you, <br>
Would they release you,<br>
Crimson bird, <br>
Scarlet scrap in the wind?<br>
Would  winged passion <br>
Be bound? <br>
<br>
Let the winds, <br>
Let the winds tear your love to paper scraps,<br>
<br>
Let the winds blow you apart <br>
<br>
So your passions<br>
Will fly to that part of your meaning <br>
Exceeding who <br>
You will ever be.<br>
<br>
Cardinal  bird,<br>
Red bird,<br>
Scrap of love,<br>
Over western Kansas <br>
By now.<br>
<br>
The empty, <br>
<br>
Bleeding prison,<br>
Servitude in the ore<br>
Mines darkened <br>
In the <br>
Cloud Mountain.<br>
<br>
Free them,  free your passions, let your<br>
Passions fly away,<br>
Your passions will  soon<br>
Come back home.<br>
They will!  They’ll come back to you!<br>
<br>
The seat of your passion <br>
Wings the air,<br>
Has wings!<br>
A woman helpless in her seat of passion, winging <br>
 …. The wind dying from around her <br>
Airborne chair,<br>
Drifting …<br>
Falling …<br>
… maybe bouncing a last gust, now a<br>
<br>
Plastic bag <br>
Stuck in a<br>
Last chance <br>
Prophet’s  <br>
Burning bush.<br>
<br>
Oh Bleeding Swan, come to me, <br>
I’ll tend your wound, dear Swan,<br>
Swan, your finger <br>
Bleeding, staining my hands,<br>
Stained white<br>
With my love for you so burning pure.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Touch</b></font><br>
<br>
God is the tip of a living finger … that is to say,<br>
Things are themselves while we’re <br>
Conscious of sensation,<br>
Touching.<br>
<br>
We would not say we had ten gods,<br>
The freewill of skin, <br>
To itself an articulate chamois <br>
Even when drug by sight,<br>
Vicarious touch <br>
A dove <br>
Resting on a jumpy thigh of Jupiter.<br>
<br>
The surfaced world,<br>
Surfaces broken to newly<br>
Existent surfaces, surfaces, <br>
And touch.<br>
<br>
Even if the window glass doesn’t have to <br>
Realize it’s smooth,<br>
Or the weathered wood it’s rough,<br>
We teach those dumb forms<br>
The reality of being,<br>
And yes, after<br>
Becoming so superficially educated,<br>
They say yes and  become everything.<br>
<br>
What is the delight <br>
Of the imaginary?<br>
At what instances is it entirely possible<br>
For you to slide,<br>
Hot bare feet over glass, or<br>
Slip your leg<br>
Down into the rains that have weathered wood?<br>
<br>
This is me speaking — who<br>
Am a surface  — feel me. feel me! I am all that is!<br>
<br>
Fingers soar, bank left, dive, loop, climb to the sun,<br>
They have joined the doves! <br>
With your touch upon me you’re creating me …<br>
Flying free <br>
On the ability to be the god<br>
Of what you want,<br>
And we your subjects, we each of surface,<br>
Delight at your touch rising up into<br>
And falling from being.<br>
Delight at your touch rising and falling from being, mutually<br>
Delighting in our own truest ongoing creation — you have been created, <br>
The creation ongoing,<br>
Newly.<br>
Feeling it, your finger’s eternal lessons<br>
Without moving … but slide them, feeling, pressing, <br>
Sensation creating everything.  <br>
<br>
You are touching. <br>
Affective …<br>
Don’t waste a moment more!<br>
<br>
Pull her body close, hold him to yourself ..<br>
Life! True Person …<br>
True Person …<br>
… touch all the way through!<br>

<font size="+1"><b>Wing of Color</b></font><br>
<br>
That long, beautiful, feathered thing<br>
Feathered out from east to west<br>
Through rain unwet, up<br>
In clouds not opaque —<br>
That wing of color up there!<br>
You must remember<br>
That long unwet, not opaque<br>
Wing of color that day,<br>
When you took that long walk with yourself …<br>
Tipped your head back,<br>
Up to that long beautiful wing<br>
All alone up there …<br>
<br>
That single wing of color <br>
Like you’d see <br>
Most days …<br>
You must remember<br>
That long unwet, not opaque <br>
Colored wing up there in the sky all alone,<br>
But for the first time, <br>
Stopped from your walk, looking up,<br>
The display of a surprising <br>
Mating wing<br>
— how unexpected! Wings in pairs! —<br>
The wing of understanding <br>
From south to  north that <br>
Not unlucky day,<br>
The Engraved Bird of Passing Time<br>
Displaying two shoulders,<br>
Meridians of the heavens<br>
On moving time,<br>
The wing of color crossing  under<br>
The wing of understanding<br>
Passing in front of<br>
The empty hole that<br>
Before that moment<br>
Had been your heart.<br>
<br>
Your heart become a rain of rainbows <br>
Curved over the dome of the <br>
Not opaque sky that rainy unwet day<br>
From the horizon all around,<br>
<br>
Directly Under the center of the umbrella sky,<br>
The intersection of rainbows that umbrella day,<br>
Bows covering over the hole in your heart. <br>
The intersection of<br>
The Winged Rainbow of Color, and<br>
The Winged Rainbow of Understanding<br>
Looking directly down<br>
At your place on the top of the little planet<br>
Dancing with your <br>
Wobbling sky umbrella. <br>
<br>
The Engraved Bird of Passing Time<br>
A sky with Rainbows for wings,<br>
Umbrella struts for wingtips on the rim<br>
Around the bowl of planet earth,<br>
The cupped brown nest<br>
 While engraving silver<br>
—  Introspection in this case becoming metallurgy —<br>
Flutters us home<br>
To our cavorting mother<br>
Of pearl moment we never knew we lived through<br>
In the first place.<br>
<br>
Inlaid abalone birds, they could be.<br>
Room divider of our aesthetics, they could be.  <br>
Impossible, inlaid, lucent,<br>
Curling up out of that place without thickness,<br>
And you forgot your house,<br>
Your disregard for your household<br>
Let it fall down flat all around you<br>
When you were<br>
Standing there ready to dance,<br>
Flat on wings that have become a carpet,<br>
And there could never not exist the spinning dancer,<br>
Spinning off drops of nectar.  And you are free color<br>
color of understanding  … free … so … <br>
then tell us, please,<br>
how nectar beads on the flesh<br>
of what you have scoured for signs<br>
of redemption.<br>
<br>
Keep to yourself, please, what you think of <br>
coming up empty.<br>
<br>
Shall we gather around the campfire,<br>
raise wolf pelts and crack spheres of glass for the sun?<br>
Throw in more of what if burnt would from wind incinerate the howl?<br>
<br>
Tell us — how  does nectar appear?<br>
What nail hole waits <br>
with its gift of purity?<br>
<br>
From the palm of what woman’s hand,<br>
what will seep up out of a pore in her skin,<br>
to  glisten in the understanding<br>
the artifact, a fragment <br>
from the idea that each thing<br>
reclining in itself<br>
will remain itself, <br>
is itself,<br>
cold, white stone, hard, pure,<br>
that would,<br>
 on a new light of her soul be,<br>
the burn of passion.<br>
